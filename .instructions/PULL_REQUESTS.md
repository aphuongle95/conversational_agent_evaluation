# Pull Request Guidelines

This document outlines the process for creating and merging pull requests (PRs).

## Creating a Pull Request

1.  **Branch:** Create a new branch from `main` for your changes. Use a descriptive branch name (e.g., `feature/add-new-auth-logic`, `fix/resolve-login-bug`).
2.  **Commits:** Make small, logical commits with clear and concise commit messages.
3.  **Title:** The PR title should be clear and descriptive. It should summarize the changes made.
4.  **Description:** The PR description should provide context for the changes. Explain the "what" and "why" of the changes. If the PR addresses an issue, link to it.
5.  **Reviewers:** Add at least one reviewer to your PR.
6.  **Checks:** Ensure that all automated checks (e.g., linting, tests) are passing.

## Reviewing a Pull Request

- Be constructive and respectful.
- Focus on the code, not the person.
- Provide clear and actionable feedback.
- If you suggest changes, explain why they are needed.

## Merging a Pull Request

- A PR can be merged once it has been approved by at least one reviewer and all checks have passed.
- Use a "squash and merge" to keep the commit history clean.
